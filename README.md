# Pong SDL2 C

## Notice

Game is built as a high-speed hack implementation. Full of code smells and bad
practices, duplicate functionality, abstraction layer violations, etc.

Left here as a personal reference for mistakes made during big-bang development
/ lack of design. Makes a good candidate for tools like SonarQube.
